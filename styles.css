/* EXERCISE 1
            For every Album we'd like to have a consistent style.
            Create a class for:
            - The album container
            - The album cover
            - The album title
            - The album group / singer / dj
            - The album genre
            - The album duration
            - etc

            to make sure you give every album the same consistent appearance.
